QRAPP: A Code Hunting App
This is a code hunting app in which players compete to scan the most and highest scoring codes in existence. A sample use of the app and its features is in the 'doc' folder entitled "QRAPP.webm".

Once any scannable code is scanned, a unique name and visual representation of the code is generated and its score calculated. Nearby Codes are shown on a map to see scanned codes in the area. Check out the leaderboards for the most prolic code hunters in the app.

Happy QRAPPing!!
